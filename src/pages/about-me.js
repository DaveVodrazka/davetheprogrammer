      <h1>Hi, I'm Dave</h1>
      <p>
        My full name is David Vodrážka and one of the reasons why I created this website is to see myself when I google my name, which is why I use it quite extensively.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in the Czech Republic (it should be Czechia now, but I don't agree), I'm stationed in the capitol - Prague.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programming use to be just something I was learning out of curiosity, but now it pays my bills. I am employed in Seznam.cz, which is a pretty big deal here in the Czeach Republic (no, not Czechia).
      </p>
